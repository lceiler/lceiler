Welcome to the comprehensive guide to biomedical engineering at the 
University of Alabama at Birmingham! My name is Logan; I'm creating this 
guide not only as a study tool for you but also for me. I learn best when 
I teach a concept to someone else in the simplest terms that I can break
it down to. This project is a byproduct of my study habits, and I hope
it's helpful to you.

This is a collection of practice problems, concept explanations, and 
example code that should be helpful on your journey to become a biomedical 
engineer. DO NOT turn this material in for any of your assignments;
if you don't learn this stuff, your boss at your first job is going to be pissed if you 
 don't know what a flow cytometer is. That said, this material is open to the public. 
 Do with it what you wish within legal and ethical boundaries.

BME is a vast and highly technical field that requires you to have
at least a rudimentary understanding of every other field of 
engineering. I believe that makes it the most difficult major on 
campus and makes for one of the most competitive job environments 
in the world. This makes us eligible to make use of just about every advantage 
that we can get our hands on, and I hope to make this a good one. 

If you have any questions or requests for new material, email me at lceiler@proton.me
